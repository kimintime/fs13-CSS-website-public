## About this storefront:

This storefront template website was created with some heavy CSS, experimenting with animations and hover effects, as well as using display flex and grid layout.

## Personal Comment

I can very much see the point of SCSS, and we had the option to implement it for this design. However it was just a case of being far down the rabbit hole to stop and go back.
